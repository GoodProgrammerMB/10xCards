## Backend

### Guidelines for .NET

#### ASP.NET

- Use minimal APIs for simple endpoints in .NET 6+ applications to reduce boilerplate code
- Implement the mediator pattern with MediatR for decoupling request handling and simplifying cross-cutting concerns
- Use API controllers with model binding and validation attributes for {{complex_data_models}}
- Implement proper exception handling with ExceptionFilter or middleware to provide consistent error responses
- Use dependency injection with scoped lifetime for request-specific services and singleton for stateless services

#### Entity Framework

- Use the repository and unit of work patterns to abstract data access logic and simplify testing
- Implement eager loading with Include() to avoid N+1 query problems for {{entity_relationships}}
- Use migrations for database schema changes and version control with proper naming conventions
- Apply appropriate tracking behavior (AsNoTracking() for read-only queries) to optimize performance
- Implement query optimization techniques like compiled queries for frequently executed database operations
- Use value conversions for complex property transformations and proper handling of {{custom_data_types}}
